# About me

### Bachelor's Degree Student in Statistics
I just completed my first year of college at Universidade Federal Fluminense, during this time I learned a lot and discovered that I am capable of things that I would never have imagined. I learned a lot about data science as well and have a growing interest in the area, because of this, I want to discover more about programming in phyton and R.
